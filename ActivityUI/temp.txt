Clash Royale–Themed Trading Application — User Activity UI
- Technical Stack
Frontend: React / Next.js
Backend: Node.js
Design: Incorporate Clash Royale–style visuals, fancy images, and animated effects to create an engaging, game-like atmosphere.

- Core UI Layout
The main page features two interactive portals:
Execution Portal — for placing and managing trades.
Result Portal — for viewing trade outcomes and statistics.

1. Login Page (Mock Implementation)
Create a login screen resembling a company trading account.
Users enter mock credentials (User ID and Password) to access the system.
Authentication is mocked only — no backend logic required yet.
On successful login, redirect to the main dashboard with the two portals.
2. Trading Panel (Execution Portal)
The Execution Portal allows users to input trade details:
Action: Buy / Sell, Price, Company Name, Amount
Use a mock translator API to convert trade information into a Clash Royale–style “deck of players.”
Add immersive animations and images inspired by Clash Royale when trades are entered or processed.
3. Start Play Button
Include a “Start Play” button that redirects to the Clash Royale game platform (placeholder for now).
The user’s game result determines whether the trade executes or fails.
4. Trade Outcome Logic (Mocked)
After gameplay (mocked for now), poll a trading API to simulate trade results:
Win → The trade executes successfully.
Loss → The trade fails.
Display feedback messages with Clash Royale–style animations (e.g., trophies, defeat flames, or confetti).
5. Result Portal
Fetch and display trading statistics and trade execution history from the mocked trading API.
Use Clash Royale–inspired graphics (e.g., player avatars, crowns, badges) to visualize performance.

- Future Extensions (For Later Implementation)
Add multi-user support for a company view, showing multiple traders’ results in one dashboard.
Implement real-time updates and live game–trade integration.
Include leaderboards for competitive trading performance.
